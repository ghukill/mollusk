Mollusk

## Overview

Mollusk is a CLI and python library (`mollusk`).  The CLI can be used to create new repositories, where then the `mollusk` library is used.  This is similar to other python projects, e.g. Django, where there are commands to initialize and manage applications but it's also a python library.  If there is not a term for this, there should be ðŸ˜Ž.
